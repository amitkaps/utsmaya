          <h2>The Workshop Journey</h2>
          <p> Everyone can flourish at work. Bloom, thrive, and prosper. We each have a seed in us that if provided the right nourishment and support can flower in its own unique way. We don’t need to follow any traditional path or fit ourselves into a framework of how everyone works. We need to explore and find our own true nature and craft the unique way in which we can succeed in our endeavours at work and beyond.</p>

          <p> In this workshop, we will be using three different lenses, in the form of three different art forms - theatre (role plays), storytelling and music (percussions) to get started on this journey. Each art form would be used on one day as the chosen medium of expression, exploration and discovery.</p>

          <p> We will start this journey from inside to the outside. We will begin with an awareness about ourselves and our own unique presence.Then try to understand how we communicate with people and how do we craft our own narrative - to tell our own unique story. Finally, we will explore how we interact within a group and try and find your own rhythm within a group.</p>
          
          <p> But how do we start on this exploration? Only, if we are willing to step out of our traditional logical-analytical self - our left brain, and are willing to look at the world through a different lens, a lens which is maybe more oral, aural, visual and kinesthetic - our right brain, then there is a potential to explore these topics in a different light. </p>
